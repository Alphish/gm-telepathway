Game made by Alice for GMC Jam 35
Additionally, it was playtested by mp (also, they contributed a level to the game)

Some generic logic was made before the Jam. Specifically:
 - files and JSON handling
 - the configuration logic (bgm/sfx/fullscreen toggling)
 - audio handling (taking into account the configuration)
 - clickable buttons handling (rectangular and circular buttons)
The other parts done by me were after the Jam started.

Hopefully I didn't leave anything that needs further explanation.
