About
=====

This repository contains a source code of "Telepathway" (or "Telepath's Escape"), a game made for [Game Maker Community Jam 35](https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?threads/the-festive-gmc-jam-35-discussion-topic.68682/).

This project is more or less the same like the original entry submitted for the Jam, except for the following changes:
- fixed a bug with enemies checking - the WIN state was triggered when there was no enemy in `width x width` area (instead of `width x height`)
- replaced each sound asset with one second of silence, so that I wouldn't distribute other people's audio assets

**You are allowed to** browse, adapt and re-use any logic contained in this project, more specifically the GML contained in Scripts and Object events, as well as the general Objects properties, hierarchy etc.

Crediting me isn't strictly necessary (especially if it's about small and generic pieces of code, e.g. reading a whole file as a string) but it would be appreciated.
Likewise, if my code helped you create some cool project, I would be happy to know about that.

**You are NOT allowed to** use the following:
- graphical assets (Sprites)
- level designs (Included Files, "levels" folder)
- the story, along with related writing

More specifically, you can't use the above beyond personal use, unless I give you a specific permission to do so.
For example, using the sprites included in the Telepathway project to compile it is an acceptable personal use. Including these sprites in your own project is not allowed (even if you credit me).

If I didn't specifically mention a certain type of asset or other kind of intellectual property, **you should assume its use is disallowed**, just like with Sprites for instance.
